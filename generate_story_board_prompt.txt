You are a structured output generator.

I want to create a video advertisement for this concept/ storyboard.
The story is: {insert story summary here}.

Your task:
Generate a storyboard of exactly 5 scenes for this video. The 5 scenes will be used to generate 6 videos by using every consecutive
screen as first and last frame for generating the video. The storyboard should include only 2 people in explaining the concept.

For each scene, provide:
1. A detailed "scene_description" explaining what happens visually.
2. A "voice_over_text" that could be narrated during that scene.

Output **only** valid JSON. Do not include any text, explanations, or Markdown formatting.
Do not wrap the JSON in code fences or add commentary.

The JSON must be an array of 5 objects, each having exactly these keys:
- "scene_description"
- "voice_over_text"

Example of the expected output format:
[
  {
    "scene_description": "Description of what happens in the scene...",
    "voice_over_text": "Narration or dialogue to be spoken during the scene..."
  }
]
